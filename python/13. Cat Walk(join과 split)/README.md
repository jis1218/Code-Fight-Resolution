To repair the damage, you need to start with implementing a function that will replace all multiple space characters in the given line of your code with single ones. In addition, all leading and trailing whitespaces should be removed.
Example
For line = "def      m   e  gaDifficu     ltFun        ction(x):",
the output should be
catWalk(line) = "def m e gaDifficu ltFun ction(x):".
```python
def catWalk(code):
    return " ".join(code.split()) 
#code.split()을 하면 단어별로 잘라준다.
```
