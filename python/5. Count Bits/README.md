Implement a function that, given an integer n, uses a specific method on it and returns the number of bits in its binary representation.
Note: in this task and most of the following tasks you will be given a code snippet with some part of it replaced by the ellipsis (...). Only this part is allowed to be changed.
```python
def countBits(n):
    return n.bit_length()
```
